    Located in the South-Western part of Pokhara valley, Chhorepatan Secondary
School is one of the leading institutions in and around the valley. In more than a
decade-long journey, CSS has been able to prove itself as a milestone with
academic identity in Pokhara. To meet the needs of quality education in
secondary education, CSS had been upgraded to XI & XII in 2055 B.S. with
Humanities and Social Sciences stream. Later on, Management and Education
streams were launched in 2056 and 2061 B.S. respectively in response to the
cordial demands of the parents and students. Our successful expansion has
been further marked by the addition of the science stream in 2066 B.S. The
quality of the science stream is evidenced by a 90+ pass percentage in 2073,
